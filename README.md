The purpose of the Session Long Project in Trident University classes is to give you the opportunity to explore the applicability of the Module to your own life, work, and place in space and time, and to experiment with the Module to see how the otherwise academically rigorous presentation of a topic may, with more or less work and/or trauma, become “up close and personal”.  This is done in a number of different ways — sometimes cumulative papers, sometimes practical hands-on experimentation with a tool of some sort, sometimes reflections on a place of work or life.  The common thread is personal application, aimed at demonstrating a cumulative knowledge and understanding of the course’s material.

<strong>Assignment:</strong>

For this module, your task is to apply what you have learned about information security management frameworks to your own experiences or issues of interests. If the issue is a large-scale, complicated one, you can choose to provide an overview here and then keep discussing the same issue but with much more depth from the different perspectives in each SLP for this course. Or you can choose to discuss different issues in different modules.

Your own experiences or interests can come from your organizational work or from your personal life. If you don’t have any experiences on this topic (which I hardly think so) or you think your experiences are not so relevant, then find a public issue, interview people, or do some search on the Internet.

Please apply your preferred framework of information security management to discuss an information security issue in your organization or in your personal life. Some examples are access control, virus protection, virtual private networking, business continuity, disaster recovery, etc.

Please write a 2-3 page write-up titled:

<strong>“Applying Information Security Management Framework(s) in __________ (the information security issue of your choice)”</strong>

Assignment Expectations:

Your paper should:

1) Introduce the information security issue

2) Choose one or two preferred framework(s) that best apply to the issue, and support with why

3) Discuss the potential different perspectives needed to be considered when managing this issue
